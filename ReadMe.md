# About me
My name is Rafał Szeląg. I am master of law and barrister. I graduated from University of Marii Curie-Skłodowski in Lublin, Poland. I passed bar exam and started my own law firm. I've always been interested in software and websites development. Recently I decided to become software tester. Here I would like to share my experience.
